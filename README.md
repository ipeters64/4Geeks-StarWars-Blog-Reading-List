Built a starwars databank using swapitech React Flux framework. Html, Bootstrap and Javascript were involved as well. 
Characters and Planets can be saved under a users' "favorites" category.

Brief descriptions of the characters and planets are given as well. They are displayed as "card" elements that Bootstrap uses and expands to a full description when either a character or planet is clicked on.
